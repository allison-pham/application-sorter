","Yes. I am into Pre-Med based electrical engineering. I got a grant for SURF at Lamar University for EEG Biofeedback for Arachnophobia. The following is the abstract: In the United States, millions of people suffer from arachnophobia, or the fear of spiders, which poses a significant challenge to their daily routines. Despite various attempts to alleviate arachnophobia, effectiveness and efficiency remain elusive in many cases. This proposed research study aims to confront this challenge by investigating the effectiveness of EEG (electroencephalography)-based biofeedback in patients with arachnophobia. EEG biofeedback assists patients by providing real-time feedback on brainwave activity, incorporating techniques such as breathing exercises, and mindfulness to promote relaxation and enhance self-regulation of emotional responses. This technique has been successfully applied for other conditions, such as attentional bias in high trait anxiety individuals (Sheng, 2013). Participants will be put in two different randomized groups. One group will receive placebo feedback and the other will receive real EEG-biofeedback. Participants in the biofeedback group will engage in sessions where EEG-based biofeedback will be administered either with exposure to spider-related stimuli through a virtual reality headset or a screen. Assessments conducted before, after, and during follow-up periods for both groups will provide insights into the interventions' efficacy. In addition to standardized measures, cortisol levels will be examined through pre- and post-intervention saliva samples. Recent advancements in anxiety level detection offer promising insights drawn from individuals grappling with spider phobia, underscoring the potential of our approach. If successful, the development of efficient anxiety treatment techniques through EEG biofeedback could provide millions of people suffering from arachnophobia with relief throughout their day-to-day life. Additionally, the results could open the door to using these methods to treat a variety of other phobias, which could help the way we approach and manage numerous anxiety-related conditions. I am also in a Research team at Lamar University for Dr Edyth Kirk for psychology. We are researching the relation of social media and how it causes relationship breakups.

Along with that, having an opportunity to work in “Biology” to write a research paper on evolutionary/ environmental biology etc. 

2- In “Social Sciences and Humanities” i would like to participate in “Psychology and Political Science”

3- Last but not the least, “Art and Literature” would be fun yet an opportunity to learn something different from science, so it will be a great learning process of getting experience and exposure.","Unfortunately, I haven’t conducted or experienced any research projects yet, but I am open to experiencing new things and learning throughout this process.","I see this opportunity which will help me to be a part of such a tremendous initiative. To shape me as an individual, to develop leadership qualities within me and to learn the importance of research work. I believe there is still a lot in store for me to experience and learn so many new things out there. I believe in punctuality and discipline and through this program, i’ll be able to follow my motto and mindset, which has always been with our teammates, to be cooperative and understand the core value of our work. Having an opportunity to participate in something which i am passionate about will give me a chance to play my role accurately and to take my responsibilities seriously.",Cosmic-us Instagram,,Yes,Yes,I don’t have such requirements but i would like to be explained about the details of the program/ deadlines etc beforehand so that it’ll be convenient for me to be aware of my tasks and work punctually. ,"The individuals who will be selected for this program, will they work in team or as individually?

How can customer reviews (of any kind) influence the purchasing decisions of consumers and potential customers? Since user-generated content (UGC) is becoming a lot more popular nowadays (especially in the lifestyle and healthcare sectors), this project would shed light on how we, as consumers, perceive businesses and how this digital marketing strategy influences our purchasing decisions. I want to conduct studies on how UGCs influence purchasing decisions and how the quality of UGCs affects their credibility and appeal to potential consumers. While gathering this information, I'd like to experiment with smaller businesses and analyze the results from surveys, online reviews, and social media posts!","While I have never participated in formal research initiatives, I do have extensive experience in business, finance, and marketing. My previous experience as a DECA chapter executive, combined with my two years as an Ontarian provincial qualifier in its marketing cluster, will allow me to deliver the greatest possible experience to my group as either the lead researcher or a general researcher on my team! Having awareness As a marketing professional for HNP Ontario, I also had the opportunity to get firsthand knowledge of what makes a successful brand. There, I oversaw the non-profit's Instagram account, responded to fellow NPOs, and worked on graphic design and content development.","- While I have a lot of marketing expertise from my time as a Marketing Associate with HNP Ontario, I'd like to learn more about the analytics and logistics that go into building a successful campaign. 

-Under a mentor's supervision, I would like to investigate the formula for data collection in a research project, as well as how I might apply those processes to future research projects.

- I hope to leverage my expertise as a Cosmic researcher to pursue other such volunteer or paid research positions in the future!

- Another goal of mine is to improve my presentation skills, which will be important for the final presentation of my team's findings! 

- My long-term goal is to use what I've learned from this experience to launch or help expand businesses, such as working as a social media manager for my father's real estate firm or becoming an entrepreneur. I believe that my chosen research topic is extremely important for anyone who wants to build a business in the future, because the capacity to control your digital marketing strategies can make or break your company.",Cosmic-us Instagram,,Yes,Yes,"I do not, however I would greatly appreciate having a mentor for this research topic. ",I do not!
